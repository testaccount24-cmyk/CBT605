 7.18 New Password Exit (NEWPXIT)

 This exit gains control when a new password is supplied at system
 entry time and when the PASSWORD field is specified through the ACF
 CHANGE or INSERT subcommands.  It is a self-contained load module
 that must reside in the link pack area (LPA).  Specify the module
 name in the NEWPXIT field of the GSO EXITS record.

 Specification:  GSO EXITS record, NEWPXIT field

 Attributes:  AMODE 31, RMODE ANY

 Environment:  Key 0, supervisor state
 Step-must-complete status
 Reserve (if shared DASD).

 Called by:  System entry validation
 Logonid record modification.

 Input:  Uses a standard OS calling sequence:
  R1   Standard parameter list:
     +0 Address of ACVALD or ACALT parameter list
     +4 Address of eight-character new password
     +8 Address of logonid record.

 Output
  R15   Set one of the following return codes:
      0  Continue, password is valid.
      4  Invalid password, message returned in ACVMSG or ACAMSG area.
         If you issue your own message, a return code of 255 appears
         in the Invalid Password/Authority Log (ACFRPTPW).

     8  Invalid password, use CA-ACF2 message.
         The ACF01037 NEW PASSWORD DENIED BY INSTALLATION EXIT
         message is issued during system entry validation.
         The ACF00156 PASSWORD REJECTED BY INSTALLATION EXIT
         message is issued for an invalid logonid update.

     12 Invalid password, message returned in the ACVMSG or  ACAMSG
         area.  The logonid record is written back to the logonid
         database with any the exit may have made.   Return 255
         appears in the Invalid Password Authority Log (ACFRPTPW).

     16 Invalid password, use CA-ACF2 message.  The logonid record
        is written back to the logonid database with any updates the
        exit may have made.

 Note:  Return codes 12 and 16 may be used, for example, to maintain
        counter of attempts at setting a new password.  Care must be
        taken in using return codes 12 and 16; installation
        programming error exit could cause corruption of the logonid
        record.  Also be aware additional I/O incurred by return
        codes 12 and 16 may affect performance.

 You cannot use the New Password exit to prompt a user to reenter his
 password.  Use the CA-ACF2 Logon Prevalidation exit for that purpose.
 Also, you cannot use the New Password exit to make any CA-ACF2 SVC
 call that requires a logonid record to be read from or written to the
 Logonid database.  This causes an S138 abend.

 If the password was never set in the user's logonid record, such as
 during the first logon attempt, NEWPXIT receives a new password of
 hexadecimal zeros or blanks.   In this case, the exit should validate
 the ACVPSWD field in the ACVALD parameter list.  Ignore the password
 supplied in the parameter list.  This situation can occur only during
 system entry validation, never for ACF command-originated PASSWORD
 field modifications.
