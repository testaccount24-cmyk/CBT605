//***FILE 605 is a group of programs designed to help with a        *   FILE 605
//*           conversion from ACF2 to RACF.  This package will      *   FILE 605
//*           assist in capturing all the ACF2 passwords.           *   FILE 605
//*                                                                 *   FILE 605
//*      This PDS contains old sloppy code written for one use.     *   FILE 605
//*      The purpose was to save ACF2 log on id passwords to        *   FILE 605
//*      allow us to switch to RACF without us having to change     *   FILE 605
//*      the passwords for any users.                               *   FILE 605
//*                                                                 *   FILE 605
//*      These programs were able to obtain the needed data, but    *   FILE 605
//*      the data had to be manually edited before it could be      *   FILE 605
//*      used.                                                      *   FILE 605
//*                                                                 *   FILE 605
//*      It's been a few years since I used it, but seem to         *   FILE 605
//*      remember that I started with exit LGNIXIT which didn't     *   FILE 605
//*      give what I wanted.  At the last minute, I had to          *   FILE 605
//*      switch to exit SEVPRE ?  That could be backwards.          *   FILE 605
//*                                                                 *   FILE 605
//*      Use at your own risk.  Buyer beware.                       *   FILE 605
//*                                                                 *   FILE 605
