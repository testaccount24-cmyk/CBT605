*
*    This PDS contains old sloppy code written for one use.
* The purpose was to save ACF2 log on id passwords to allow
* us to switch to RACF without us having to change the
* passwords for any users.
*
*    These programs were able to obtain the needed data, but the
* data had to be manually editted before it could be used.
*
*    It's been a few years since I used it, but seem to remember
* that I started with exit LGNIXIT which didn't give what I wanted.
* At the last minute, I had to switch to exit SEVPRE ?
* That could be backwards.
*
*    Use at your own risk.  Buyer beware.
*
*    You can send questions to somitcw@erols.com
* There is no promise that I can help.
*
*    LGNPARMS, LGNPXIT, and NEWPXIT are not mine.
* They are samples or information from elsewhere.
